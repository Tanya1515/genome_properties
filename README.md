**Programm checking the following properties of DNA:**
+ #C=#G, #T=#A (# - amount of nucleotides)
+ There are few words CG in some genomes and there are few words TA in all genomes 
+ GÐ¡ skew

**How to constract the program:**

1. Clone the programm from the repository. 
2. cd properties_of_genome
3. gcc properties_of_DNK.c
4. ./a.out file_with_genome.txt (example: ./a.out hiv.txt )
